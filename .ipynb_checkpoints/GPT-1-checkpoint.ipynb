    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "In this task, you will create a Python script using PyTorch to implement a simplified GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model for character-level language modeling. The model will be trained on the text in input.txt to predict the next character in a sequence and generate new text based on a given context. The architecture follows the decoder part of the transformer model from the \"Attention is All You Need\" paper by Vaswani et al., focusing on masked multi-head self-attention to ensure predictions depend only on previous positions."
